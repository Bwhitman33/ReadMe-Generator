# ReadME-Generator

## Description
This is the challenge for Module 9 of the Rutger's Coding Bootcamp. This challenge was to create an app that will allow a user to generate a professional ReadME for their projects by answering a few simple questions. 

## Installation
This project is dependent on npm and inquirer. You can download these by navigating to your terminal and (under the root directory you will be working in) entering "npm init" and pressing enter, followed by entering "npm i inquirer" and pressing enter

## Usage
To use this project, please enter "Node index.js" into your terminal and then answer the questions that you will be prompted to answer. Once you have finished answering these questions, simply check the "generated_ReadME" folder for your new ReadME!
